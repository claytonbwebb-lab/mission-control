# Bright Stack Labs — Mission Control

A private operations dashboard for Bright Stack Labs.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components (wouter routing)
- **Backend**: Express.js serving frontend + AI usage proxy routes
- **Theme**: Dark mode by default, toggleable light/dark

## Features

### Authentication
- Single-user password login via `POST {VITE_API_URL}/auth/login`
- Token stored in `localStorage` as `bsl_mc_token`
- All external API calls include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- Protected routes redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated

### Section 1 — Mission Board (`/`)
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop (`@hello-pangea/dnd`)
- Columns: Ideas, In Progress, Review, Complete
- Task cards with: title, description, project label, priority badge, assignee chip, date
- Add card button per column, click-to-edit modal with activity log
- Activity log: chronological entries (comments, status changes, field changes) from `GET /tasks/:id`
- Comment posting via `POST /tasks/:id/activity` with `{ author: "steve", content }`
- All saves (modal + drag-drop) include `author: "steve"` for attribution
- Filter bar by project label
- API: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE {VITE_API_URL}/tasks`, `GET /tasks/:id` (with activity), `POST /tasks/:id/activity`

- API: Various `/posts`, `/pages`, `/generate` endpoints on `VITE_API_URL`

### Section 3 — Architecture (`/architecture`)

### Section 4 — AI Usage (`/ai-usage`)
